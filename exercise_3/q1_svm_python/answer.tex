\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
Number of SV: 3\\
Accuracy on train data with C = 1000: 1.0 \\
Accuracy on test data with C = 1000: 0.8648648648648649 \\

\subsubsection*{Adjustments to \texttt{apply\_a.py}}
\texttt{python apply\_a.py} threw a lot of errors, which were mainly due to not enforcing a datatype (i.e. matrix vs nparray) and not taking the dimensions requested in \texttt{simlin.py} into account.\\

For this reason, we have modified \texttt{apply\_a.py}.

\subsection*{(b+c)}
\subsubsection*{1-vs-3}
Number of SV: 26 \\
Width of margin: 0.000527852066940575 \\
Train Error 1-vs-3: 7 \\
Test Error 1-vs-3: 0.013953488372093023 \\

\subsubsection*{3-vs-8}
Number of SV: 89 \\
Width of margin: 0.00010191438464165348 \\
Train Error 3-vs-8:  66 \\
Test Error 3-vs-8:  0.09939759036144578

\subsubsection*{Adjustments to \texttt{apply\_bc.py}}
As \texttt{python apply\_a.py}, \texttt{python apply\_bc.py} threw a lot of errors, which were mainly due to not enforcing a datatype (i.e. matrix vs nparray) and not taking the dimensions requested in \texttt{simlin.py} into account.\\

For this reason, we have modified \texttt{apply\_bc.py}.

\subsection*{(d)}
Accuracy of kernel SVM with C=1000 and norm=5: 0.40540540540540543

This shows, that the accuracy of the kernel SVM is much lower than the accuracy of the linear SVM.

\subsubsection*{Adjustments to \texttt{apply\_d.py} and \texttt{svmkern.py}}
There was a mismatch between the number of variables unpacked from the function \texttt{svmkern} in \texttt{apply\_d.py} and the number of variables to be returned by this function, defined by its description. We have extended the function to return the same values as \texttt{svmlin}.\\
As with the previous adjustments that had to be made, we again had to enforce datatypes and dimensions.
